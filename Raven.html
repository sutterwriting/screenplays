            &emsp;“The brain. The world's most advanced and complicated super computer. All its mysteries have yet to be unlocked. It is more powerful than any of you can possibly imagine. It has power. Superheroes are no longer myth. You all have powers hidden inside you, waiting to be unlocked.”
          </br>
          </br>
            &emsp;These words inspire Josh Lee to unlock his mind and connect with the girl he loves. By channeling his love for Ava McRae, Josh is able to send a signal to her. ”Ava, I love you.” These simple words begin the process for Josh and Ava to become telepathically connected. When you are inside someone’s head with no barriers and filters between you and them, you begin to understand that person better than anyone alive has ever known anyone.
          </br>
          </br>
            &emsp;Despite herself, Ava finds herself falling in love with Josh and enjoying the closeness that telepathy allows. But this happy time cannot last. After getting in a car accident, Josh flees the pain into the dark recesses of his mind in the only place he feels safe. A cottage by a river with an unfamiliar woman. Ava dives deeper and deeper into Josh in an attempt to bring him back and heal him. With Ava’s help, Josh is finally able to face the pain and fear that has defined his life.
            </br>
            </br>
            &emsp;Josh’s parents are not what they seem to be. Alan and Ursula Lee are religious fanatics that have taken it upon themselves to purify the world of the unbelievers. Josh’s real mother happened to be one of these unbelievers. After witnessing the brutal rape and murder of his mother, Josh is adopted by the Lee’s in an attempt to purify Josh’s righteous bloodline.
            </br>
            </br>
            &emsp;The pain of his loss has kept the memory of Josh’s mother deep in his sub-conscience. Now, he can face it. Now, he can finally find happiness.
            </br>
            </br>
            &emsp;Many years pass in happiness. Using their telepathy, Ava is able to fulfill her lifelong dream to become a famous singer. But the riches that are associated with fame makes her into a target. After a robbery gone wrong, Ava is killed. In the deepest well of grief and anger, Josh kills every single robber without mercy.
            </br>
            </br>
            &emsp;After grieving for Ava, Josh realizes that she is inside him. Ava passed into Josh at the moment of her death. Now, they must decide if they can find happiness where they are or if they must find a way for Ava to live on in another body.
            </br>
            </br>
            &emsp;Raven Silva. Convicted serial killer sentenced to death. This is the body that Ava decides to possess to live on. But the sub-conscience of someone this evil cannot before destroyed by death. Raven breaks free and threatens to kill an entire city using her newly acquired telepathy.
